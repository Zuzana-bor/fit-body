## About

I'm not a certified fitness trainer, but I used to go to the gym myself. However, while on maternity leave, I was forced to start exercising alone from home, which is where the idea for this app came from. If you look for training sessions on YouTube, you don't have to compile them yourself and think about suitable settings. This application will tailor everything for you.

As an added bonus, you will also find out your daily caloric intake, based on your goals. Calorie calculation uses the Harris-Benedict method. And you will also get advice for better sleep at the end.

## Future plans

- React hook form
- Form validation
- Localization
- Responsive design
